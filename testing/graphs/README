GTgraph: A suite of three synthetic graph generators:
1) SSCA2: generates graphs used as input instances for the DARPA
   High Productivity Computing Systems SSCA#2 graph theory benchmark.
2) Scale-free: generates graphs power-law degree distributions and small-world characteristics.
3) Generates random graphs.
